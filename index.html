      <h1 class="heading-primary">Hello this is Albinot Blakçori</h1>
      <p class="first-p">
        Hello this is Albinot Blakçori I am a 24 year old highly motivated
        individual, a very relaxed and also no complex person I always was a
        very energetic person. I finished Elementary and High School and
        immediately after that I started working. I currently work as an
        Executive <br />Assistant for Oxford Porperty Group a REAL ESTATE
        company located in New York Manhattan. Ihave been working there for the
        last<br />
        3 years a place which I learned a lot and got better and progressed a
        lot especially with the experience I am gaining there, I do have hobbies
        as every other person I like playing football I also enjoy playing
        Counter Strike I like watching movies as well cause I really feel that
        movies <br />are a good way of relaxing and also a good way to get a new
        idea or a new perspective on how you see things in life. Mostly I am
        sometimes a perfecionist which most of the time comes to my benefit, but
        for the last year I have been very interested into getting into the
        <br />
        Programing world this is something new to me and I like challenges, this
        is why in the last couple of days I decided to join a COURSE regarding
        programing. At the moment I am foucsed on my job and getting thing done
        but also focusing on getting better and better into the Programing world
        which I consider to be my future.
