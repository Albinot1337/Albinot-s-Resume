      <h1>Hello this is Albinot Blakçori</h1>
      <p>
        Hello this is Albinot Blakçori I am a 24 year old highly motivated
        individual, a very relaxed and also no complex person I always was a
        very energetic person. I finished Elementary and High School and
        immediately after that I started working,
        <br />
        I currently work as an Executive Assistant for Oxford Porperty Group a
        REAL ESTATE company located in New York Manhattan. I have been working
        there for the last 3 years a place which I learned a lot and got better
        and progressed a lot especially with the experience I am gaining there,
        I do have hobbies as every other person I like playing football I also
        enjoy playing Counter Strike I like watching movies as well cause I
        really feel that movies are a good way of relaxing and also a good way
        to get a new idea or a new perspective on how you see things in life.
        <br />
        Mostly I am sometimes a perfecionist which most of the time comes to my
        benefit, but for the last year I have been very interested into getting
        into the Programing world this is something new to me and I like
        challenges, this is why in the last couple of days I decided to join a
        COURSE regarging programing. At the moment I am foucsed on my job and
        getting thing done but also focusing on getting better and better into
        the Programing world which I consider to be my future.
